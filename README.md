# ITA-GCN

This repository implements a ITA-GCN model in PyTorch, designed for brain disorder classification tasks. The model leverages a self-expressive learning mechanism to adaptively model intrinsic relationships among brain regions, and incorporates brain community detection to identify interactions among brain functional communities.
